# HSU Microservice Framework

The **Host System Unit (HSU)** framework provides a clean, pluggable framework for composing larger applications from independent, language-agnostic microservices running locally or distributed across the network. This framework enables lightweight orchestration and management of distributed services in resource-constrained environments such as edge computing or embedding systems.

Unlike Kubernetes, which separates orchestration into dedicated services (API server, etcd, controllers), the HSU framework allows to integrate orchestration directly into the services typically selecting one of them as a master process. This eliminates the overhead of maintaining separate orchestration infrastructure while combining service discovery, lifecycle management, and business logic dispatch in a single, efficient process.

## Distributed Architecture (Planned)

> **Note**: The following describes the planned distributed architecture. Current implementation focuses on single-node orchestration with multi-node capabilities planned for future releases.

### Multi-Node Coordination
- **Master Node Election**: Consensus-based leader election for high availability
- **Node Discovery**: Automatic discovery and registration of HSU nodes across network segments
- **Tunnel-Based Networking**: Secure, encrypted communication channels between distributed nodes
- **Configuration Synchronization**: Distributed configuration management across the cluster

### Service Mesh Integration
- **Native Service Discovery**: gRPC-based service registry with health checking
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent request routing between HSU instances
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic failure detection and traffic isolation
- **Observability**: Distributed tracing and metrics collection across HSU network

### Deployment Model
- **Declarative Configuration**: YAML-based HSU deployment specifications
- **Rolling Deployments**: Zero-downtime updates with configurable rollback policies
- **Resource Management**: Cross-node resource allocation and constraint enforcement
- **Secrets Distribution**: Encrypted secrets management across distributed nodes

## Core Concepts

| Concept                  | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unmanaged HSU process** | External processes that exist independently of the master process. The master can discover, monitor, and perform basic control operations (start/stop/kill) but does not manage their complete lifecycle. Examples include system services, databases, or pre-existing applications. |
| **Managed HSU process**          | Processes whose complete lifecycle is controlled by the master process. The master manages startup, shutdown, environment variables, working directories, and I/O redirection. These processes are typically custom applications designed to work within the HSU ecosystem. |
| **Integrated HSU process**       | Fully managed processes that implement standardized gRPC interfaces for deep integration with the master process. They support advanced features like health checks, graceful shutdown, structured logging, and custom business logic APIs. These represent the highest level of HSU integration. |
| **HSU Master process**   | Central orchestration service responsible for HSU discovery, lifecycle management, health monitoring, log aggregation, and API gateway functionality. Acts as the single point of control for all HSUs in the system. |
| **Interface A / B ...**    | Domain-specific gRPC service interfaces that extend the core HSU functionality. Examples include LLM management APIs, data processing interfaces, storage adapters, or custom business logic services. |
| **gRPC Interface Stack** | Collection of generated client stubs and protobuf definitions that enable type-safe communication between the master process and integrated HSUs. Supports multiple programming languages and versioned API contracts. |


### Typical Use Cases

The HSU architecture excels in scenarios requiring lightweight microservice orchestration with varying levels of process control. Here are common implementation patterns organized by HSU category:

#### Unmanaged HSU Use Cases
These scenarios involve integrating with existing systems while maintaining minimal interference:

- **Database Integration** – Monitor PostgreSQL/MySQL servers, track connections and performance metrics, implement connection pooling
- **System Service Management** – Integrate with SSH daemons, Docker containers, message queues (Redis, RabbitMQ) for discovery and health monitoring
- **Third-Party API Gateways** – Monitor external services, track response times, implement circuit breaker patterns
- **Legacy System Integration** – Connect with existing applications without modification, providing modern APIs over legacy interfaces

#### Managed HSU Use Cases
Perfect for custom applications requiring full lifecycle control:

- **Batch Processing Workers** – Spawn data processing jobs on-demand, manage job queues, handle failure recovery
- **Microservice Components** – Deploy and manage custom REST APIs, background services, and scheduled tasks
- **Development Tooling** – Control development servers, testing frameworks, and build processes
- **Resource-Intensive Tasks** – Manage GPU-intensive workloads, temporary compute jobs, and seasonal processing spikes

#### Integrated HSU Use Cases
Advanced scenarios leveraging deep gRPC integration for complex business logic:

- **LLM Management Platform** – Control model servers (Ollama, vLLM), manage inference requests, handle model loading/unloading, implement request routing and load balancing
- **Machine Learning Pipeline** – Orchestrate training jobs, manage experiment tracking, control data preprocessing, handle model deployment and A/B testing
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System** – Manage document ingestion, vector database operations, query processing, and response generation
- **Media Processing** – Control video transcoding workers, manage encoding queues, handle thumbnail generation, implement streaming protocols
- **Real-Time Analytics** – Process streaming data from Kafka/Kinesis, manage stateful processors, handle windowing operations, implement alerting systems
- **Storage Orchestration** – Manage object store operations (S3, MinIO), implement caching strategies, handle data replication and backup
- **Notification Systems** – Control multi-channel dispatchers (email, SMS, push notifications), manage templates and personalization, handle delivery tracking

#### Hybrid Deployments
Complex systems often combine multiple HSU types:

- **Edge AI Platform** – Integrated HSUs for ML inference + Managed HSUs for data collection + Unmanaged HSUs for existing sensor networks
- **Content Management System** – Integrated HSUs for media processing + Managed HSUs for background jobs + Unmanaged HSUs for database and cache layers
- **IoT Data Pipeline** – Integrated HSUs for stream processing + Managed HSUs for device simulators + Unmanaged HSUs for time-series databases
