# HSU Platform: Kubernetes for Native Applications

## Problem

Kubernetes revolutionized container orchestration but falls short in:
- **Edge computing environments** with limited resources and intermittent connectivity
- **On-premises deployments** requiring native process control and legacy system integration
- **Desktop applications** needing modular architectures without container overhead
- **Embedded systems** where containers are impractical or impossible
- **Development environments** requiring lightweight orchestration of diverse tooling

## Solution

HSU provides Kubernetes-like orchestration for native applications, offering:
- **Automated deployment and scaling** across distributed nodes
- **Service discovery and configuration management** for native processes
- **Health monitoring and self-healing** without container dependencies
- **Multi-language gRPC APIs** for deep integration and type-safe communication
- **Resource-efficient operation** optimized for constrained environments

## Key Differentiators

- **Native Process Control**: Direct OS-level process management without container overhead
- **Edge-Optimized**: Designed for resource-constrained and offline-ready environments
- **Hybrid Integration**: Seamlessly manages existing processes alongside new deployments
- **Multi-Language Support**: gRPC-based APIs enable implementation in any language
- **Lightweight Architecture**: Single binary master process with minimal resource footprint

## Core Architecture

The **Host System Unit (HSU)** architecture divides all services into two primary roles:
- **HSU (Host System Units)** – Standalone processes or services that implement specific functionality within the system
- **Master Processes** – Long-running resident processes responsible for HSU discovery, orchestration, and lifecycle management

The architecture provides a continuum of integration: from passive observation (Unmanaged Units), to full process lifecycle control (Managed Units), to deep API orchestration (Integrated Units) — making it highly adaptable to real-world hybrid systems.


### HSU Categories

The architecture supports three distinct categories of units, each offering different levels of integration and control:

#### 1. Unmanaged Units
Unmanaged units are processes whose lifecycle is **not controlled** by the master processes. However, the master process can still perform basic management operations such as:
- **Discovery**: Locate processes by name or identifier
- **Monitoring**: Retrieve memory usage, CPU consumption, and health status
- **Basic Control**: Terminate processes when necessary

These capabilities leverage standard OS-level APIs, and HSU libraries provide cross-platform abstractions for common operations.

**Examples**:
- Database servers (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- System services (SSH daemon, Docker daemon)
- Third-party applications already deployed in the environment

#### 2. Managed Units
Managed units are processes whose **complete lifecycle** is controlled by the master processes. The master process has full authority over:
- **Process Control**: Start, stop, and restart operations
- **Environment Management**: Working directory, environment variables
- **I/O Handling**: stdout/stderr redirection and processing
- **Configuration**: Command-line parameters and runtime arguments
- **Limits**: CPU, RAM constrains

**Examples**:
- Custom application workers spawned on-demand
- Batch processing jobs with defined lifecycles
- Monitoring agents controlled by a central orchestrator

#### 3. Integrated Units
Integrated units represent the highest level of integration, combining full lifecycle management with **deep programmatic integration** through gRPC APIs. These units implement:
- **Core gRPC Interface**: Standard functionality (health checks, graceful shutdown, logging)
- **Business-Specific APIs**: Custom gRPC services for domain-specific operations
- **Multi-Language Support**: Can be implemented in any language supporting gRPC (Go, Python, Rust, Java, etc.)

The master process communicates with integrated units through generated gRPC client stubs, enabling type-safe, versioned API interactions.

**Examples**:
- ML inference servers with model management APIs
- Data processing pipelines with job control interfaces
- Storage adapters implementing standardized CRUD operations

### Design Philosophy

The HSU architecture doesn't prescribe specific microservice design patterns or domain boundaries. Instead, it provides a **lightweight orchestration layer** that combines Kubernetes-like process management with business API clients in a single, low-footprint master process.

This design enables microservices architectures in resource-constrained environments:

- **Dynamic Resource Management**: Spin HSUs up and down based on demand to optimize CPU/RAM usage
- **Third-Party Integration**: Attach to and control existing processes or services without modification
- **Language Agnostic Development**: Implement integrated HSUs in the most suitable language for each use case
- **Edge Computing Ready**: Minimal overhead suitable for embedded systems and edge deployments

## Distributed Architecture (Planned)

> **Note**: The following describes the planned distributed architecture. Current implementation focuses on single-node orchestration with multi-node capabilities planned for future releases.

### Multi-Node Coordination
- **Master Node Election**: Consensus-based leader election for high availability
- **Node Discovery**: Automatic discovery and registration of HSU nodes across network segments
- **Tunnel-Based Networking**: Secure, encrypted communication channels between distributed nodes
- **Configuration Synchronization**: Distributed configuration management across the cluster

### Service Mesh Integration
- **Native Service Discovery**: gRPC-based service registry with health checking
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent request routing between HSU instances
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic failure detection and traffic isolation
- **Observability**: Distributed tracing and metrics collection across HSU network

### Deployment Model
- **Declarative Configuration**: YAML-based HSU deployment specifications
- **Rolling Deployments**: Zero-downtime updates with configurable rollback policies
- **Resource Management**: Cross-node resource allocation and constraint enforcement
- **Secrets Distribution**: Encrypted secrets management across distributed nodes

## Core Concepts

| Concept                  | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unmanaged HSU process** | External processes that exist independently of the master process. The master can discover, monitor, and perform basic control operations (start/stop/kill) but does not manage their complete lifecycle. Examples include system services, databases, or pre-existing applications. |
| **Managed HSU process**          | Processes whose complete lifecycle is controlled by the master process. The master manages startup, shutdown, environment variables, working directories, and I/O redirection. These processes are typically custom applications designed to work within the HSU ecosystem. |
| **Integrated HSU process**       | Fully managed processes that implement standardized gRPC interfaces for deep integration with the master process. They support advanced features like health checks, graceful shutdown, structured logging, and custom business logic APIs. These represent the highest level of HSU integration. |
| **HSU Master process**   | Central orchestration service responsible for HSU discovery, lifecycle management, health monitoring, log aggregation, and API gateway functionality. Acts as the single point of control for all HSUs in the system. |
| **Interface A / B ...**    | Domain-specific gRPC service interfaces that extend the core HSU functionality. Examples include LLM management APIs, data processing interfaces, storage adapters, or custom business logic services. |
| **gRPC Interface Stack** | Collection of generated client stubs and protobuf definitions that enable type-safe communication between the master process and integrated HSUs. Supports multiple programming languages and versioned API contracts. |


### Typical Use Cases

The HSU architecture excels in scenarios requiring lightweight microservice orchestration with varying levels of process control. Here are common implementation patterns organized by HSU category:

#### Unmanaged HSU Use Cases
These scenarios involve integrating with existing systems while maintaining minimal interference:

- **Database Integration** – Monitor PostgreSQL/MySQL servers, track connections and performance metrics, implement connection pooling
- **System Service Management** – Integrate with SSH daemons, Docker containers, message queues (Redis, RabbitMQ) for discovery and health monitoring
- **Third-Party API Gateways** – Monitor external services, track response times, implement circuit breaker patterns
- **Legacy System Integration** – Connect with existing applications without modification, providing modern APIs over legacy interfaces

#### Managed HSU Use Cases
Perfect for custom applications requiring full lifecycle control:

- **Batch Processing Workers** – Spawn data processing jobs on-demand, manage job queues, handle failure recovery
- **Microservice Components** – Deploy and manage custom REST APIs, background services, and scheduled tasks

## Quick Start (demo)

```bash
# 1. Generate Go client stubs (example language)
make gen-go

# 2. Build example HSUs
make build‑example

# 3. Run the main process (will auto‑spawn HSUs on demand)
./bin/main
```

---

## Defining a New Interface for integrated HSUs

1. Drop a new proto in ``.
2. Run `make gen‑all` to regenerate stubs for every target language.
3. Implement an HSU that registers `hsu_xyz`.
4. Add the new client stub to the main process dependency list.

### 📄 Placeholder – gRPC Proto Definition

```proto
// proto/hsu_xyz.proto
syntax = "proto3";
package hsu.xyz;

// TODO: replace with real service definition
service XYZ {
    rpc DoSomething (XYZRequest) returns (XYZResponse);
}
```

---

## Implementing an integrated HSU

### Go Example (implements Core + A)

```go
// cmd/hsu_a_service1/main.go
// TODO: full implementation
func main() {
    // 1. Parse flags & config
    // 2. Register Core and Interface A servers
    // 3. Serve gRPC
}
```

### Python Example (implements Core + B)

```python
# cmd/hsu_b_service1/main.py
# TODO: full implementation
async def serve():
    # 1. Instantiate Core & B servicers
    # 2. Start aio gRPC server
```

### Rust Example (implements Core, A & B)

```rust
// cmd/hsu_abc_service/src/main.rs
// TODO: full implementation using tonic
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // register services and serve
}
```

## Runtime Lifecycle

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Main process] -- ping/start --> B[HSU process]
    B -- register --> A
    A -- RPC calls --> B
    A -- stop --> B
```

1. **Discovery** – main process checks if an HSU is running, or spawns it.
2. **Handshake** – HSU registers active interfaces via Core API.
3. **Workload** – main invokes RPCs.
4. **Shutdown** – idle HSUs are stopped to free resources.

---

## Extending the System

- **Add a language** – run that language's gRPC code‑gen tool for all `.proto` files.
- **Swap an implementation** – stop current HSU binary, launch alternative.
- **Compose** – an HSU can expose *multiple* interfaces in one process to save IPC.
